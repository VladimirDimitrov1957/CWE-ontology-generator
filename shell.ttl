Please see the RelatedNatureEnumeration simple type definition for details about the valid value and meanings. The optional Chain_ID attribute specifies the unique ID of a named chain that a CanFollow or CanPrecede relationship pertains to. The optional Ordinal attribute is used to determine if this relationship is the primary ChildOf relationship for this weakness for a given View_ID.

The RelatedNatureEnumeration simple type defines the different values that can be used to define the nature of a related weakness. A ChildOf nature denotes a related weakness at a higher level of abstraction. A ParentOf nature denotes a related weakness at a lower level of abstraction. The StartsWith, CanPrecede, and CanFollow relationships are used to denote weaknesses that are part of a chaining structure. The RequiredBy and Requires relationships are used to denote a weakness that is part of a composite weakness structure. The CanAlsoBe relationship denotes a weakness that, in the proper environment and context, can also be perceived as the target weakness. Note that the CanAlsoBe relationship is not necessarily reciprocal. The PeerOf relationship is used to show some similarity with the target weakness that does not fit any of the other type of relationships."""^^rdfs:Literal .

The value \"High\" is used to describe a method that succeeds frequently and does not result in many false reports. The value \"Moderate\" is used to describe a method that is applicable to multiple circumstances, but it may not have complete coverage of the weakness, or it may result in a number of incorrect reports. The \"SOAR Partial\" value means that according to SOAR this method can be cost-effective for partial coverage of the objective. The value \"Opportunistic\" is used to describe a method that does not directly target the weakness but may still succeed by chance, rather than in a reliable manner. The value \"Limited\" is used to describe a method that may be useful in limited circumstances, only applicable to a subset of potential instances of a given weakness type, requires training/customization, or gives limited visibility. Even in its limited capacity, this may be part of a good defense in depth strategy. The value \"None\" is used to describe a method that is highly unlikely to work. However, it may be included in an entry to emphasize common, yet incorrect, methods that developers might introduce.
\"SOAR Partial\" is used to indicate that according to the IATAC State Of the Art Report (SOAR), the detection method is partially effective.""" .

The value \"Not Technology-Specific\" is used to indicate that the entry is not limited to a small set of technologies, i.e., it can appear in many different technologies.
Notes:
- 'Client Server' represents technology involving a distributed application but for the purposes of CWE does not leverage a web browser.
- 'Cloud Computing' represents technology that involves data storage and computing power being made available to multiple users via the internet instead of using local systems, without the need for users to perform all system management themselves.
- 'ICS/OT' represents technology related to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Techology (OT), which are often considered to be distinct from Information Technology (IT) systems.
- 'SOA' represents technology related to Service-oriented architecture (SOA).
- 'System on Chip' represents technology that integrates all components of a computer within a single integrated circuit, to include FPGA and ASIC.
-'Web Based' represents technology that involves applications or single-page sites that leverage a web browser to support client interactions.
- 'Not Technology-Specific' is used to indicate that the entry is not limited to a small set of technologies, i.e., it can appear in many different technologies.
- 'Technology-Independent' value was changed in CWE 4.9/schema 6.9 and will be deprecated in schema 7.0. Use 'Not Technology-Specific' instead.""" .

A value of Obsolete is used when an entity is still valid but no longer is relevant, likely because it has been superseded by a more recent entity.  A value of Incomplete means that the entity does not have all important elements filled, and there is no guarantee of quality.  A value of Draft refers to an entity that has all important elements filled, and critical elements such as Name and Description are reasonably well-written; the entity may still have important problems or gaps.  A value of Usable refers to an entity that has received close, extensive review, with critical elements verified.  A value of Stable indicates that all important elements have been verified, and the entry is unlikely to change significantly in the future.

The ViewTypeEnumeration simple type defines the different types of views that can be found within CWE. A graph is a hierarchical representation of weaknesses based on a specific vantage point that a user may take. The hierarchy often starts with a category, followed by a class/base weakness, and ends with a variant weakness. In addition to graphs, a view can be a slice, which is a flat list of entries that does not specify any relationships between those entries. An explicit slice is a subset of weaknesses that are related through some external factor. For example, an explicit slice may be used to represent mappings to external groupings like a Top-N list. An implicit slice is a subset of weaknesses that are related through a specific attribute, as indicated by the Filter element of the View.

:Potential_Mitigation rdfs:comment """The PotentialMitigationsType complex type is used to describe potential mitigations associated with a weakness. It contains one or more Mitigation elements, which each represent individual mitigations for the weakness. The Phase element indicates the development life cycle phase during which this particular mitigation may be applied. The Strategy element describes a general strategy for protecting a system to which this mitigation contributes. The Effectiveness element summarizes how effective the mitigation may be in preventing the weakness. The Description element contains a description of this individual mitigation including any strengths and shortcomings of this mitigation for the weakness.
The optional Mitigation_ID attribute is used by the internal CWE team to uniquely identify mitigations that are repeated across any number of individual weaknesses. To help make sure that the details of these common mitigations stay synchronized, the Mitigation_ID is used to quickly identify those mitigation elements across CWE that should be identical. The identifier is a string and should match the following format: MIT-1."""^^rdfs:Literal .


:Taxonomy_Mapping rdfs:comment "The TaxonomyMappingsType complex type is used to provide a mapping from an entry (Weakness or Category) in CWE to an equivalent entry in a different taxonomy. The required Taxonomy_Name attribute identifies the taxonomy to which the mapping is being made. The Entry_ID and Entry_Name elements identify the ID and name of the entry which is being mapped. The Mapping_Fit element identifies how close the CWE is to the entry in the taxonomy."^^rdfs:Literal .
